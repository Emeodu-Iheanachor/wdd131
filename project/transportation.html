  <h2>Transportation in Lagos</h2>

  <p>
    Lagos, located in <strong>Southwestern Nigeria</strong>, is one of the busiest cities in Africa.
    Due to its large population and economic activity, transportation plays a major role
    in daily life. Visitors and residents have several options depending on budget,
    comfort, and travel distance.
  </p>

  <h3>🚍 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)</h3>
  <p>
    The BRT system operates large buses on dedicated lanes to reduce traffic delays.
    It is one of the most affordable and organized transportation methods in Lagos,
    serving major routes across the city.
  </p>

  <h3>🚐 Danfo Minibuses</h3>
  <p>
    The famous yellow Danfo buses are widely used by locals. They are inexpensive
    and operate throughout the city, though they can be crowded and fast-paced.
  </p>

  <h3>🚗 Ride-Hailing Services</h3>
  <p>
    Services such as Uber and Bolt offer convenient and comfortable rides.
    They are ideal for visitors who prefer safer and more predictable pricing.
  </p>

  <h3>🏍 Okada (Motorcycles)</h3>
  <p>
    Okadas are motorcycles used for quick movement, especially in heavy traffic.
    While fast and convenient, safety precautions are strongly advised.
  </p>

  <h3>🚤 Ferries</h3>
  <p>
    Because Lagos is surrounded by water, ferries provide transportation across
    the lagoon and help commuters avoid road congestion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Travelers are encouraged to plan trips outside rush hours (early morning and
    late evening) to reduce delays and enjoy smoother travel experiences.
